    "These tasks may include reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A self-driving car that uses computer vision algorithms to detect and understand objects on the road, analyze traffic patterns, \n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions \n",

    "\n",
    "Q2 - What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled examples. The training dataset consists of \n",
    "input data along with their corresponding labels or target outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, and location.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3 - What is unsupervised learning? List some examples of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The goal is to identify patterns, \n",
    "structures, or relationships within the data without any predefined labels.\n",
