    "Q1. Lasso Regression and its difference from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression, also known as L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression cost function. The objective of Lasso Regression is to prevent overfitting and perform feature selection by driving some of the coefficients exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression or ordinary least squares regression, is the type of penalty applied to the coefficients. Lasso's L1 penalty promotes sparsity by driving some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection, which is not a characteristic of Ridge or OLS regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to drive some of the coefficients exactly to zero. This allows Lasso to effectively select a subset of the most relevant features and eliminate irrelevant or less important ones. By removing unnecessary features, Lasso simplifies the model, reduces overfitting, and can improve the model's generalization performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to ordinary least squares regression. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to Lasso's regularization, some coefficients might be exactly zero, indicating that the corresponding feature is not contributing to the model's prediction. This allows for feature selection, and coefficients that are non-zero indicate the magnitude and direction of the impact of those features on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Tuning parameters in Lasso Regression and their effect on model performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted as λ (lambda). It controls the strength of the L1 penalty and determines the trade-off between fitting the data well (low residuals) and driving coefficients to zero (feature selection).\n",
    "\n",
    "For small values of λ, the L1 penalty is weak, and the model behaves more like ordinary least squares regression, potentially overfitting the data.\n",
    "For large values of λ, the L1 penalty becomes stronger, leading to more coefficients being driven to zero, resulting in a simpler model with less overfitting.\n",
    "Selecting the appropriate value of λ is critical, and it is commonly done using techniques like cross-validation to find the value that provides the best trade-off between model complexity and performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Using Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique, which means it is designed to model linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. However, it is possible to use Lasso Regression in combination with polynomial features to handle certain non-linear regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming the original features into higher-degree polynomial features and then applying Lasso Regression, the model can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. This approach is known as polynomial regression with Lasso regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more complex non-linear relationships, other non-linear regression techniques or machine learning algorithms might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization penalty they apply to the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 regularization) adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of squared coefficients, which tends to shrink the coefficients toward zero without forcing them to exactly zero. It is effective in handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression (L1 regularization) adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which can drive some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection. It is useful for feature selection and can handle multicollinearity by eliminating some features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Lasso Regression's handling of multicollinearity in the input features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features by driving some of the correlated features' coefficients exactly to zero. When features are highly correlated, Lasso can choose one of them while setting the others to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature selection capability is particularly valuable when dealing with multicollinearity, as it helps to eliminate irrelevant or redundant features, leading to a more parsimonious and interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Choosing the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of the regularization parameter (λ) in Lasso Regression is typically chosen through techniques like cross-validation. The dataset is divided into multiple subsets (folds), and the Lasso Regression model is trained and evaluated on different combinations of training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of λ that minimizes the average error (e.g., mean squared error or root mean squared error) on the validation sets is considered the optimal tuning parameter. Cross-validation helps to find the best trade-off between model complexity (number of non-zero coefficients) and predictive performance on unseen data."
