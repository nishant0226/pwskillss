    "Q1. The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: In label encoding, each unique category in a categorical variable is assigned a numerical label. For example, if we have categories A, B, and C, label encoding may assign them labels 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The encoding is arbitrary, meaning it does not convey any specific order or magnitude of the categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: In ordinal encoding, the categories are encoded with numerical values based on their order or rank. This encoding is suitable when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy. For example, if we have categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" ordinal encoding may assign them labels 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The encoding preserves the relative order of the categories.\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use label encoding when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order, and the model should not interpret any ordinal relationship between the categories.\n",
    "Use ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has a clear order or ranking, and the model can utilize this information for better understanding the relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns numerical labels to categories based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. It combines the target variable's information with the encoding process. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "Order the categories based on their mean or median values.\n",
    "Assign numerical labels to the ordered categories.\n",
    "Example usage: Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Education Level\" (values: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD) and a target variable \"Salary.\" To perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, you would calculate the average salary for each education level, order the education levels based on their average salaries, and assign numerical labels accordingly. This encoding can capture the ordinal relationship between education levels and salary, potentially improving the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two random variables. It measures how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps identify whether variables move together (positive covariance), move in opposite directions (negative covariance), or are independent (zero covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = Σ((X - μX) * (Y - μY)) / (n - 1)\n",
    "where Σ represents the sum, μX is the mean of variable X, μY is the mean of variable Y, and n is the number of data points.\n",

    "Gender: Since there are only two categories (Male/Female), you can use label encoding (0 for Male, 1 for Female) because there is no inherent order or ranking between the categories.\n",
    "Education Level: You can use ordinal encoding because there is an inherent order (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD). Assign numerical labels accordingly (e.g., 0 for High School, 1 for Bachelor's, 2 for Master's, 3 for PhD).\n",
    "Employment Status: Again, since there is no inherent order, you can use label encoding to assign numerical labels (e.g., 0 for Unemployed, 1 for Part-Time, 2 for Full-Time).\n",
