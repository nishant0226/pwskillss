    "'''Q1. Assumptions of ANOVA and Violations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations within each group and between groups should be independent. \n",
    "Violation: If there is a correlation or dependence among the observations, such as in a repeated measures design, \n",
    "the assumption of independence is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals (the differences between the observed values and the predicted values) should follow a normal distribution. \n",
    "Violation: If the residuals are significantly skewed or not normally distributed, it can impact the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneity of Variance: The variances of the residuals should be equal across all groups. \n",
    "Violation: If the assumption of equal variances is violated, it can affect the significance tests and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Types of ANOVA and Their Situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Way ANOVA: It is used when there is a single categorical independent variable (factor) and a continuous dependent variable. \n",
    "It compares the means of two or more groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-Way ANOVA: It is used when there are two categorical independent variables, also known as factors, and a continuous dependent variable. \n",
    "It examines the main effects of each factor and their interaction effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated Measures ANOVA: It is used when measurements are taken from the same individuals or units over multiple time points or conditions. \n",
    "It compares the means across different levels of a within-subject factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Partitioning of Variance in ANOVA:\n",
    "The partitioning of variance in ANOVA refers to the division of the total variability observed in the data \n",
    "into different sources: the variability explained by the factors or effects of interest and the unexplained residual variability. \n",
    "It is important to understand this concept because it helps to quantify the contribution of each factor and assess their \n",
