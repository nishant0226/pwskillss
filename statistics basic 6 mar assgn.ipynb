    "Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset differ from the mean. \n",
    "It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and \n",
    "then dividing by the number of values in the dataset. A higher variance indicates that the values are more spread out from the mean.\n",
